This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Netlify

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Currently using Node Version: 20.5.0

## **Ideas for the project:**

- Have all the movements on the website
- Have registration forms for all courses and curriculums
- Have AI Bot (ChatGPT) enabled for any questions that may arise

  - Make sure to have a file that has the questions and ansrs
  - Have a filter for when parishioners want to ask any questions that can not be answered such as if God Exists?
- Make sure the application is multilingual
- Add Scrollmagic and FramerMotion for Advanced CSS Animations
- Add Firebase for User Authentifation for Log in, and for tables for events
- Add topics about the Jubilee Year
- Email Marketing such as newsletter if users sign up for newsletters

  - Use Klaviyo for subscriber and have a subscribe form before the footer
- Add a page for group pictures as well
- Terms of Policy for the Page
- Make sure that each page has a unique name for the tabname

## **Create Components that are going to be global for several purposes:**


## **Add FramerMotion**

* [X] Navbar
* [X] Jumbotron
* [ ] Events Index page
* [ ] On each individual movement page
* [ ] Components
  * [ ] Chatbot
  * [ ] FullImageJumbotron
  * [ ] IconsComponent
  * [ ] MiniJumbo
  * [ ] NewletterCTA
  * [ ] SplitSection
  * [ ] UpcomingEvents
  * [ ] VideoComponent

Make sure that all movement pages have registration forms so every participant can join the group, Census would be very easy to manage and manipulate in the sense that if the indivual is no longer present, they can be taken off.
