This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

* [ ] Make sure that Payments are linked with the St.Kilian link
* [ ] Have a registration form for each movement and ask that all members please register so it can make it easier to do census

  * [ ] Have the user input data, but use the google sheets that is already there, have it start from a specific line and a specific tab. Figure out a way I could use the google sheets API to do this.
* [ ] VDisplay Virtus Bulletin:

  * [ ] Scrape Data from a PDF to display as HTML within the page, as well as register
  * [ ] Have an English PDF and a Spanish PDF
* [ ] Have a page that is diverse for concerts at St.Kilian. Also make sure the links that are added are within EventBrite with a limit of tickets available.

## **Add FramerMotion**

* [X] Navbar
* [X] Jumbotron
* [ ] Events Index page
  * [ ] Display 6 events, then a show more button to display 6 more on the same page
* [ ] Add simple motion on each individual movement page
* [ ] Components
  * [ ] Chatbot
  * [ ] FullImageJumbotron
  * [ ] IconsComponent
  * [ ] MiniJumbo
  * [ ] NewletterCTA
  * [ ] SplitSection
  * [ ] UpcomingEvents
  * [ ] VideoComponent

Make sure that all movement pages have registration forms so every participant can join the group, Census would be very easy to manage and manipulate in the sense that if the indivual is no longer present, they can be taken off.
